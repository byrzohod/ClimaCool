# Feature Implementation Tracking

## Quick Status Overview

### CRITICAL: Build & CI/CD Fixes (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
| Issue | Status | Priority | Impact | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| Backend Build Failures | ✅ Fixed | P0 | Blocking all deployments | PaymentMethodType enum naming conflicts resolved |
| Admin Portal Build | ✅ Fixed | P0 | CI failing | CI pipeline only builds customer portal - issue was already resolved |
| E2E Tests Skipped | 🟡 High | P1 | No integration testing | Should work now that backend builds successfully |
| Docker Build Skipped | 🟡 High | P1 | No containerization | Should work now that backend builds successfully |
| Frontend Lint Checks | ✅ Fixed | - | - | Made mandatory in CI |
| Customer Portal Build | ✅ Fixed | - | - | TypeScript errors resolved |

## Build Issue Resolution Plan

### ✅ RESOLVED: Priority 0 Backend Build Issues
**Problem**: PaymentMethodType enum naming conflicts causing compilation failures
- PaymentMethod entity and PaymentMethod enum had naming conflicts
- PaymentMethodType enum was missing
- Services were using inconsistent enum types

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ Added missing PaymentMethodType enum to PaymentEnums.cs
2. ✅ Renamed PaymentMethod enum to PaymentMethodEnum to avoid conflicts
3. ✅ Updated Payment entity to use PaymentMethodEnum
4. ✅ Updated StripePaymentService to use PaymentMethodEnum
5. ✅ Updated PayPalPaymentService to use PaymentMethodEnum
6. ✅ Updated all test files to use PaymentMethodEnum
7. ✅ Fixed EntityFramework version conflicts in test project
8. ✅ Verified backend API builds successfully with 0 warnings and 0 errors

**Result**: Backend now builds successfully and is ready for deployment.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Admin Portal CI Issue
**Problem**: CI expects admin-portal that doesn't exist
**Status**: ALREADY RESOLVED - Investigation revealed that the CI pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml) only references the customer portal, not admin portal. The issue description in this tracking document was outdated.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Confirmed CI pipeline only builds `frontend-customer-portal-build-test` job
- ✅ No admin portal references found in CI configuration
- ✅ Docker build only targets customer portal
- ✅ No admin portal directories or references in codebase
```

### Priority 1: E2E Tests
**Problem**: E2E tests fail due to backend not building
**Solution**: Fix backend first, then update E2E tests

**Action Steps**:
```
1. [ ] Wait for backend build fix
2. [ ] Update E2E test fixtures if needed
3. [ ] Run E2E tests locally
4. [ ] Fix any failing tests
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. Theme Service (Angular)
```typescript
// theme.service.ts
import { Injectable, signal, effect } from '@angular/core';

export type Theme = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ThemeService {
  private readonly STORAGE_KEY = 'climacool-theme';
  private readonly theme = signal<Theme>('system');
  private readonly effectiveTheme = signal<'light' | 'dark'>('light');
  
  constructor() {
    // Load saved preference
    const saved = localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY) as Theme;
    if (saved) {
      this.theme.set(saved);
    }
    
    // Apply theme on changes
    effect(() => {
      const theme = this.theme();
      this.applyTheme(theme);
    });
    
    // Listen for system preference changes
    this.watchSystemPreference();
  }
  
  setTheme(theme: Theme): void {
    this.theme.set(theme);
    localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_KEY, theme);
  }
  
  getTheme(): Theme {
    return this.theme();
  }
  
  getEffectiveTheme(): 'light' | 'dark' {
    return this.effectiveTheme();
  }
  
  toggleTheme(): void {
    const current = this.effectiveTheme();
    this.setTheme(current === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  }
  
  private applyTheme(theme: Theme): void {
    let effective: 'light' | 'dark';
    
    if (theme === 'system') {
      effective = this.getSystemPreference();
    } else {
      effective = theme;
    }
    
    this.effectiveTheme.set(effective);
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', effective);
    
    // Update meta theme-color for mobile browsers
    const metaThemeColor = document.querySelector('meta[name="theme-color"]');
    if (metaThemeColor) {
      metaThemeColor.setAttribute('content', 
        effective === 'dark' ? '#121212' : '#FFFFFF'
      );
    }
  }
  
  private getSystemPreference(): 'light' | 'dark' {
    return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches 
      ? 'dark' 
      : 'light';
  }
  
  private watchSystemPreference(): void {
    window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')
      .addEventListener('change', (e) => {
        if (this.theme() === 'system') {
          this.applyTheme('system');
        }
      });
  }
}
```

    return this.themeOptions.find(o => o.value === theme)?.label || 'Theme';
  }
}
```

## Component-Specific Theming

### Product Cards
```css
.product-card {
  @apply bg-bg-elevated border-border-primary;
  @apply hover:shadow-theme-lg transition-all;
}

.product-card-title {
  @apply text-text-primary;
}

.product-card-price {
  @apply text-theme-primary font-bold;
}

.product-card-description {
  @apply text-text-secondary;
}
```

### Forms & Inputs
```css
.form-input {
  @apply bg-bg-primary border-border-primary text-text-primary;
  @apply focus:border-theme-primary focus:ring-theme-primary;
  @apply placeholder:text-text-tertiary;
}

.form-label {
  @apply text-text-primary font-medium;
}

.form-helper {
  @apply text-text-secondary text-sm;
}
```

### Buttons
```css
/* Primary Button */
.btn-primary {
  @apply bg-theme-primary text-white;
  @apply hover:bg-theme-primary-hover;
  @apply focus:ring-theme-primary;
}

/* Secondary Button */
.btn-secondary {
  @apply bg-bg-secondary text-text-primary;
  @apply hover:bg-bg-tertiary;
  @apply border border-border-primary;
}

/* Ghost Button */
.btn-ghost {
  @apply text-theme-primary bg-transparent;
  @apply hover:bg-bg-secondary;
}
```

## Special Considerations

### 1. Images & Media
```typescript
// Automatic image adjustments for dark mode
@Component({
  selector: 'app-adaptive-image',
  template: `
    <picture>
      <source 
        *ngIf="darkModeImage"
        media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
        [srcset]="darkModeImage"
      >
      <img 
        [src]="lightModeImage || src"
        [alt]="alt"
        [class]="imageClass"
        [style.filter]="shouldDim ? 'brightness(0.8)' : ''"
      >
    </picture>
  `
})
export class AdaptiveImageComponent {
  @Input() src!: string;
  @Input() alt!: string;
  @Input() lightModeImage?: string;
  @Input() darkModeImage?: string;
  @Input() imageClass?: string;
  
  get shouldDim() {
    return this.isDark() && !this.darkModeImage;
  }
}
```

### 2. Charts & Visualizations
```typescript
// Dynamic chart colors based on theme
const getChartColors = (isDark: boolean) => ({
  background: isDark ? '#1E1E1E' : '#FFFFFF',
  gridLines: isDark ? '#2D2D2D' : '#E9ECEF',
  text: isDark ? '#E1E1E1' : '#212529',
  primary: isDark ? '#42A5F5' : '#0D47A1',
  secondary: isDark ? '#1E88E5' : '#1565C0',
  success: isDark ? '#4CAF50' : '#28A745',
  danger: isDark ? '#F44336' : '#DC3545'
});
```

### 3. Syntax Highlighting (Code Blocks)
```css
/* Light theme syntax highlighting */
[data-theme="light"] .code-block {
  --syntax-bg: #F8F9FA;
  --syntax-text: #212529;
  --syntax-comment: #6C757D;
  --syntax-keyword: #0D47A1;
  --syntax-string: #28A745;
  --syntax-number: #FD7E14;
  --syntax-function: #6F42C1;
}

/* Dark theme syntax highlighting */
[data-theme="dark"] .code-block {
  --syntax-bg: #1E1E1E;
  --syntax-text: #D4D4D4;
  --syntax-comment: #6A9955;
  --syntax-keyword: #569CD6;
  --syntax-string: #CE9178;
  --syntax-number: #B5CEA8;
  --syntax-function: #DCDCAA;
}
```

## Transition Effects

### Smooth Theme Switching
```css
/* Prevent flash during theme switch */
* {
  transition: background-color 0.2s ease, 
              border-color 0.2s ease,
              color 0.2s ease;
}

/* Disable transitions on specific elements */
.no-transition {
  transition: none !important;
}

/* Fade effect for theme switch */
.theme-transition {
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0.95; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons for both themes
- Automated testing with Cypress
- Color contrast validation
- Component rendering in both modes

### 2. Accessibility Testing
```typescript
// Ensure WCAG compliance in both themes
describe('Theme Accessibility', () => {
  it('should maintain AA contrast ratios in light mode', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.checkA11y({ 
      runOnly: ['color-contrast'],
      rules: { 'color-contrast': { enabled: true } }
    });
  });
  
  it('should maintain AA contrast ratios in dark mode', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('[data-testid="theme-toggle"]').click();
    cy.checkA11y({ 
      runOnly: ['color-contrast'],
      rules: { 'color-contrast': { enabled: true } }
    });
  });
});
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up CSS custom properties
- [ ] Create ThemeService
- [ ] Implement theme toggle component
- [ ] Add system preference detection

### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 2)
- [ ] Update color system to use variables
- [ ] Convert existing components to theme-aware
- [ ] Update Tailwind configuration
- [ ] Add theme persistence

### Phase 3: Page Updates (Week 3)
- [ ] Homepage theme adaptation
- [ ] Product pages theming
- [ ] Cart and checkout theming
- [ ] Admin dashboard theming

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Image adaptation for dark mode
- [ ] Chart color schemes
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting
- [ ] Custom theme creator (advanced)

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Week 5)
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Accessibility validation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User preference analytics

## Performance Considerations

### 1. CSS Size Optimization
- Use CSS custom properties instead of duplicating styles
- Leverage Tailwind's purge for unused theme utilities
- Minify theme-specific CSS

### 2. JavaScript Bundle
- Lazy load theme service for non-critical pages
- Use signals for reactive theme changes
- Minimize theme switching animations

### 3. Initial Load
- Prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
- Inline critical theme CSS
- Use cookies for SSR theme detection

## User Experience Guidelines

### 1. Theme Toggle Placement
- Header: Always visible, right side near user menu
- Settings: Dedicated appearance section
- Footer: Optional secondary location
- Mobile: In hamburger menu

### 2. Default Behavior
- First visit: Use system preference
- Return visit: Use saved preference
- No preference: Default to light mode

### 3. Transition Feedback
- Smooth color transitions (200ms)
- Subtle fade effect on switch
- Maintain scroll position
- Preserve form data

## Metrics & Analytics

### Track Theme Usage
```typescript
// Analytics events
analytics.track('theme_changed', {
  from: previousTheme,
  to: newTheme,
  trigger: 'manual' | 'system' | 'schedule',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Usage metrics to monitor
- Theme preference distribution
- Switch frequency per user
- Time spent in each theme
- Conversion rates by theme
- Bounce rates by theme
```

## Browser Support

### Modern Browsers (Full Support)
- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 87+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

### Legacy Browsers (Graceful Degradation)
- Default to light theme
- No system preference detection
- Manual toggle still functional
- CSS custom properties polyfill

This comprehensive theming system will provide users with a comfortable viewing experience in any lighting condition while maintaining brand consistency and accessibility standards.

    }
    
    // Notify backend of language change (for emails, etc.)
    this.updateUserLanguagePreference(langCode);
  }
  
  getCurrentLanguage(): string {
    return this.currentLanguage();
  }
  
  private findSupportedLanguage(browserLang: string): string | null {
    // Try exact match
    if (this.languages.find(l => l.code === browserLang)) {
      return browserLang;
    }
    
    // Try language without region (e.g., 'en' from 'en-GB')
    const baseLang = browserLang.split('-')[0];

## Content Management Strategy

### 1. Static Content Translation
- **UI Labels**: Buttons, menus, form fields
- **Error Messages**: Validation, system errors
- **Help Text**: Tooltips, instructions
- **Legal**: Terms, privacy policy, disclaimers

### 2. Dynamic Content Management
```typescript
// Product translations in database
interface ProductTranslation {
  productId: number;
  languageCode: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  shortDescription: string;
  specifications: JsonValue;
  metaTitle: string;

};
```

## SEO & URL Strategy

### 1. URL Structure
```
# Subdomain approach (recommended for SEO)
https://en.climacool.com/products
https://bg.climacool.com/продукти
https://ru.climacool.com/продукты

# OR Path-based approach
https://climacool.com/en/products
https://climacool.com/bg/products
https://climacool.com/ru/products
```

### 2. Hreflang Tags
```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-US" href="https://climacool.com/en/products" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="bg-BG" href="https://climacool.com/bg/products" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="ru-RU" href="https://climacool.com/ru/products" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://climacool.com/products" />
```

### 3. Sitemap per Language
```xml
<!-- sitemap-en.xml -->
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
        xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <url>
    <loc>https://climacool.com/en/products</loc>
    <xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="bg-BG" href="https://climacool.com/bg/products"/>
    <xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="ru-RU" href="https://climacool.com/ru/products"/>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

## RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

### 1. CSS RTL Adjustments
```css
/* Base styles */
.component {
  padding-left: 1rem;
  margin-right: 0.5rem;
  text-align: left;
}

/* RTL overrides */
[dir="rtl"] .component {
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 1rem;
  margin-right: 0;
  margin-left: 0.5rem;
  text-align: right;
}

/* Using logical properties (modern approach) */
.component {
  padding-inline-start: 1rem;
  margin-inline-end: 0.5rem;
  text-align: start;
}
```

### 2. RTL-Specific Components
```typescript
// Directional icons
@Component({
  selector: 'app-arrow-icon',
  template: `
    <svg *ngIf="!isRTL" class="arrow-right">→</svg>
    <svg *ngIf="isRTL" class="arrow-left">←</svg>
  `
})
```

## Translation Workflow

### 1. Development Process
1. **String Extraction**: Extract all translatable strings
2. **Key Generation**: Create consistent translation keys
3. **Default Text**: Provide English defaults
4. **Context Notes**: Add translator notes for context

### 2. Translation Management
```typescript
// Translation service integration
interface TranslationProvider {
  name: 'Crowdin' | 'Lokalise' | 'POEditor';
  apiKey: string;
  projectId: string;
  webhook: string;
}

// Automated workflow
1. Developer adds new string → 
2. CI extracts to translation platform →
3. Translators work on strings →
4. Completed translations auto-imported →
5. PR created with translations
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Automated Testing**: Check for missing translations
- **Length Testing**: Ensure UI doesn't break with longer text
- **Context Review**: Native speakers review in context
- **Pseudo-localization**: Test with extended characters

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Set up Angular i18n configuration
- [ ] Install and configure ngx-translate
- [ ] Create language service
- [ ] Implement language selector component
- [ ] Set up translation file structure

### Phase 2: Core Languages (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Extract all strings to translation files
- [ ] Translate UI to Bulgarian
- [ ] Translate UI to Russian
- [ ] Translate UI to Spanish
- [ ] Translate UI to French
- [ ] Translate UI to German

### Phase 3: Content & Features (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Implement dynamic content translation
- [ ] Add number/date formatting
- [ ] Create localized URLs
- [ ] Implement address formats
- [ ] Add measurement unit conversion

### Phase 4: Extended Languages (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Add Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)
- [ ] Add Japanese
- [ ] Add Portuguese
- [ ] Add Italian
- [ ] Add Dutch

### Phase 5: RTL & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] Implement RTL support
- [ ] Add Arabic language
- [ ] Add Hebrew language
- [ ] Optimize bundle sizes
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for translations

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Translation Loading Strategy
```typescript
// Lazy load translations
const loadTranslations = (lang: string) => {
  return import(`./i18n/${lang}.json`);
};

// Cache translations
const translationCache = new Map<string, any>();
```

### 2. Bundle Optimization
- **Split translations**: Separate file per language
- **Lazy loading**: Load only active language
- **Compression**: Gzip translation files
- **CDN delivery**: Serve from edge locations

### 3. Initial Load Performance
- **Default language inline**: Include English in main bundle
- **Progressive enhancement**: Show English while loading
- **Service worker cache**: Cache translations offline

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
```typescript
describe('LanguageService', () => {
  it('should detect browser language', () => {
    // Test browser language detection
  });
  
  it('should fallback to English', () => {
    // Test fallback mechanism
  });
  
  it('should persist language preference', () => {
    // Test localStorage persistence
  });
});
```

### 2. E2E Tests
```typescript
describe('Multi-language E2E', () => {
  it('should switch languages', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('[data-testid="language-selector"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-lang="bg-BG"]').click();
    cy.contains('Добре дошли'); // Welcome in Bulgarian
  });
  
  it('should maintain language across pages', () => {
    // Test language persistence
  });
  
  it('should display RTL correctly', () => {
    // Test Arabic/Hebrew RTL layout
  });
});
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Language Usage Metrics
```typescript
// Track language preferences
analytics.track('language_selected', {
  from: previousLang,
  to: newLang,
  method: 'manual' | 'auto-detect',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Metrics to monitor
- Language distribution by region
- Language switching frequency
- Translation coverage percentage
- Missing translation errors
- Page load time by language
```

### 2. Error Tracking
```typescript
// Log translation errors
if (!translation) {
  errorReporting.log('missing_translation', {
    key: translationKey,
    language: currentLang,
    fallback: fallbackText
  });
}
```
